# Task: Support an existed Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CI) flow 

# Description:
 - Create a starter pipeline for the programming language of choice based on the given examples: Creating your first Pipeline (jenkins.io).
 - Add new steps to the existing stage, e.g. shell script.
 - Add new stages to existing pipeline, e.g. manual approval and shell script archiving.

 # Questionnaire for Mentor

## Clarification Questions

### 1. Pipeline Requirements
   - Are there specific requirements for the programming language or naming conventions in the starter pipeline?
   - Is there an example or template pipeline setup to guide this task?

### 2. Existing CI/CD Flow
   - Could you clarify the existing CI/CD setup we're building on? Is Jenkins the current CI/CD tool, or another one?
   - Are there specific tools, configurations, or types of environments (e.g., development, staging, production) that we need to integrate or maintain in this pipeline?

### 3. Pipeline Enhancements
   - What functions should the new shell script steps perform in the existing stage? Any guidelines on testing, deployment, or environment setup?
   - For the manual approval stage, are there criteria for triggering approvals and notifications?
   - What should the shell script archiving stage achieve (e.g., save artifacts, logs)? Are there specific files or locations for archived data?

### 4. Definition of Done
   - For the pipeline to be considered complete:
      - Should it demonstrate a successful run with all stages functioning correctly?
      - Are there specific validation or test steps to include?
      - Is documentation required (e.g., README) to outline pipeline setup and usage?

### 5. Additional Clarifications
   - Are there security or access considerations for the pipeline (e.g., credentials management)?
   - Will this pipeline interact with other jobs or tools in the CI/CD environment?
