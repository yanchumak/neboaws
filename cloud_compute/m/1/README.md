# AWS Auto Scaling Policies: Step Scaling vs. Simple Scaling

## Overview

- **Step Scaling Policy**: Scales the instances in increments based on how much a metric deviates from the threshold. Step scaling relies on **CloudWatch alarms** to control when scaling actions are triggered. Multiple instances can be added at once depending on the level of load, allowing a quick response to high demand.
- **Simple Scaling Policy**: Scales the instances by a fixed adjustment and enforces a cooldown period before initiating another scaling action. This gradual scaling approach is useful for avoiding frequent scaling actions during smaller fluctuations in load.

## Key Differences Between Step Scaling and Simple Scaling

| Feature                           | Step Scaling Policy                                                             | Simple Scaling Policy                                               |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scaling Adjustments**           | Can scale by **different amounts** depending on the severity of the metric deviation. For example, if the metric exceeds the threshold significantly, the policy might add multiple instances at once. | Scales by a **fixed adjustment** (e.g., add or remove 1 instance) regardless of the metric deviation. |
| **Concurrent Scaling Actions**    | **Supports concurrent scaling actions**: Can add or remove multiple instances in a single scaling event, or trigger multiple actions quickly based on metric deviations. | **Waits for cooldown**: Each scaling action is followed by a cooldown period. The policy does not allow new actions until the cooldown expires, making scaling more gradual. |
| **Cooldown Period**               | **No cooldown parameter in Step Scaling policies**: CloudWatch alarms manage the frequency of scaling actions, making a cooldown setting unnecessary. | **Cooldown required**: Simple scaling policies require a cooldown period, which is the wait time after a scaling activity completes before a new scaling activity can be triggered. |
| **Typical Use Cases**             | **High variability in demand**: Useful for applications with sudden and large spikes in demand, where multiple instances may need to be added quickly. | **Steady or gradual load changes**: Suitable for applications with steady or gradual changes in load, where scaling needs to be more controlled. |

## Example Use Case

Consider an application with high CPU utilization that needs dynamic scaling.

### Step Scaling Example (for Scaling Out)

If CPU utilization exceeds 60%:
- **60%-80% CPU utilization**: Add **1 instance**.
- **Above 80% CPU utilization**: Add **2 instances**.

With step scaling, if CPU utilization rises sharply (above 80%), two instances will be added at once, quickly adjusting to the increased load. Scaling frequency is managed by the CloudWatch alarm configuration, not by a cooldown setting.

### Simple Scaling Example (for Scaling In)

If CPU utilization drops below 30%:
- **Simple scaling policy** removes **1 instance**.
- **Cooldown period** of 60 seconds ensures no additional scaling action until this period has elapsed.

This ensures instances are removed gradually, helping maintain stability by avoiding rapid instance termination.

## When to Use Each Policy

- **Step Scaling**: Best for applications with unpredictable, rapid changes in load where immediate response is crucial. For example, e-commerce sites with traffic spikes.
- **Simple Scaling**: Ideal for applications with stable or slowly changing load patterns where smoother, gradual scaling is preferred. Suitable for back-end services with predictable workloads.

## Conclusion

Both step scaling and simple scaling policies have their unique strengths:
- **Step Scaling** can quickly address large increases in demand by adding multiple instances simultaneously.
- **Simple Scaling** offers controlled scaling by waiting between actions, preventing rapid fluctuations in capacity.

By using these policies strategically, you can ensure that your application scales efficiently to meet demand without unnecessary or disruptive adjustments.
